# Intro
Based on a recent report (ITPro, 2022), there is a big shift to unconventional programming languages (i.e., Golang or Rust) by malicious software (malware) authors. Due to its platform-agnostic nature, Rust Based Malware (RBM) provides an effective method to attack victims at scale. For example, Rust-based Ransomware, such as BlackCat and Hive have become popular and are even provided as Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS), offering cybercriminals without technical capability a fairly simple way to extort from victims across different platforms (ITPro, 2022). <br>

As defined by Deldar and Abadi (2023), zero-day malware emerges as a previously unseen threat, which makes it challenging to detect, identify or mitigate against. Whether known or unknown, RBM exhibits similar characteristics and behavioural patterns to zero-day malware. There is a lack of effective mitigation solutions for RBM, and the novel features within RBM also make detection or prevention more difficult. <br>

Furthermore, Rust performs well at disguising malware from analysts and makes reverse engineering challenging (Praveen and Almobaideen, 2023). To effectively address the ongoing arms race between analysts and RBM, it is imperative to conduct comprehensive research and analysis on RBM. This endeavour will contribute to the enhancement of existing detection mechanisms. <br>

# QA
### Q1. What's difference between orginal PixSys and this one?
### Ans
Originally, PixSys was designed for monitoring 4 VMs in the same internal virtual network. This project is slightly different in the number of monitored VM which is only 1. Hence, I've modified some parts within the files to generate visualisation properly.
