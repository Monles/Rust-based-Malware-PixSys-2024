# Intro
(Coming soon)


# QA
### Q1. What's difference between orginal PixSys and this one?
### Ans
Originally, PixSys was designed for monitoring 4 VMs in the same internal virtual network. This project is slightly different in the number of monitored VM which is only 1. Hence, I've modified some parts within the files to generate visualisation properly.
